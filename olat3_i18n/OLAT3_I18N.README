This project is part of the e-learning system OLAT. It contains application specific 
translation files for all optional languages. 

You only need to check out this project when you want to setup your own translation 
server. But, we strongly recommend using the public translation server available at

http://translation.olat.org

To use this project in your installation you must configure the i18n.application.src.dir
property in the olat3/build.properties to point to this directory. Example:

i18n.application.src.dir = /usr/local/olat3_i18n/src/main/java

In addition, you must set the property is.translation.server=true


Again: normally there is no need to checkout this project and configure your translation
server. Instead, download the zipped language pack from olat.org.
