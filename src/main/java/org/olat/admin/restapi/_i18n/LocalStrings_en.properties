chelp.managed.ID=Via REST API an optional external ID can be attached to courses and groups. For courses an additional external reference can be used to help identify the resource for end users. 
chelp.managed.flags=If such external ID's are used for courses or groups, the external systems must also configure for each external resource which elements in OpenOLAT are managed by the external system and which can be modified within the OpenOLAT user interface. This is configured with so called "managed flags". Either all elemens are managed or the managed elements are listed in detail. The configuration of the "managed flags" are described in the technical documentation of the REST API. 
chelp.managed.enabled=If the external management is enabled, the user elements in the OpenOLAT user interface configured to be "managed" are displayed non-editable. In addition, the external ID's are used in search fields, detail pages and tables. Other non managed resources can be used and managed within OpenOLAT as usual.
managed.objects=Externally managed courses and groups
