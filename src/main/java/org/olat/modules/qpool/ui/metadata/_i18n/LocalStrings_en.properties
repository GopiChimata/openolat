chelp.question.1=The <b>Item analysis</b> is a set of (statistical) methods, with which individual question items are evaluated and assessed pertaining to their suitability for knowledge measurement respectively assessment with regard to the scope of the test. Typical parameters are the difficulty index and the discrimination index.
chelp.question.2=The <b>difficulty index</b> expresses with a value between 0 and 1 how difficult it is to answer a question, and thus indicates how many individuals of a group of candidates correctly solve the question in relation to the maximum achievable score. The purpose of the difficulty index is to discriminate individuals with high characteristic values from those with low characteristic value. Therefore all items that could be solved by any individual or items that could not be solved by anyone, are useless (index value close to 0 or 1). Items with values \u200B\u200Bclose to 0 are too simple and do not distinguish between the performance of individuals and items with values \u200B\u200Bclose to 1 are too difficult. \r\nPlease note that in a multiple choice question with 5 response options (4 distractors), there is a 20% probability that the answer was guessed. Items in the area of \u200B\u200B0.4-0.9 or 40-90% are suitable for a good performance discrimination.
chelp.question.3=The <b>standard deviation</b> (of the item difficulty) expresses with a value between 0 and 1 the dispersion of individual scores on that item, thus indicating how widespread the responses were. If the test scores are distributed as a normal curve, one standard deviation comprises about 68% of the scores above and below the mean, while two standard deviations cover 95.5% of all values in the value distribution. The lower the standard deviation, the more "stable" the difficulty index on one or several test candidate universes, the larger, the more "unstable" it is. Items with a high standard deviation should therefore be selected with utmost care.
chelp.question.4=The <b>discrimination index</b> expresses with a value between -1 and +1 the ability of an item to discriminate candidates with good and poor knowledge of the material being tested. \r\nIt provides an estimate of the degree to which an individual item is measuring the same thing as the rest of the items of the test. The discrimination index is therefore the most important parameter in the item selection process. It is calculated as the product moment correlation coefficient between student responses to a particular item and total scores on all other items on the test. In order to achieve a good performance discrimination items with distinct positive indices are required, if possible higher than or equal to .20, but certainly higher than .10. \r\nItems with a very low discrimination index do not contribute to differentiation, those with negative indices even run counter to the item selection process and should not be used in follow-up testing.
chelp.question.5=In addition, information on the number of distractors is provided.
chelp.question.6=If the question is used in one or more tests, you will find the exact number here. This will automatically increase when used in a test. Finally, notes on the suitability of the item for use in formative or summative tests can be found here.
