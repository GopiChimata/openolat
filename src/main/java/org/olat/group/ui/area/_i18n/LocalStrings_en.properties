chelp.desc.area.intro=Learning areas are used to easily assign groups to different elements within a course. Instead of explicitly listing all relevant groups in the access and visibility rules, just add the learning area.

If, on the other hand, a learning area is edited by adding or removing groups, no access rule needs to be modified, and thus the course doesn't need to be published.
