chelp.desc.area.intro=Learning areas are used to grant access to different areas of the course to certain groups in a simple way. The advantage over the explicit listing of all relevant groups in the visibility and access conditions of course elements is the increase of flexibility and the simplified handling in the course editor. When adding a group to a group rule in the course editor, the course has to be published every time and the group has to be added to every course element that should follow this access rule. In contrast, when using a learning area instead, the changes in the course editor has to be made only once and assigning the groups to those learning areas is a simple task that does not require re-publishing of the course.
