README IMPORTANT
================

Whilst the transition to Maven takes place it is necessary
both to simulate the standard directory structure for a web
application and to correctly link the dependent modules
(i.e., OLAT Core and the web application.) Moreover the necessary
directory and project re-organization has been postponed until
the existing version system (CVS) is replaced with a more
appropriate distributed version control system.

Accordingly we create a "module" for the web application at
this directory level and let its parent directory play the
role of aggregate project.
