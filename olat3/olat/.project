  <comment>Welcome to OLAT (Online Learning And Training), the web-based open source Learning 
  Management System (LMS) based on Java and completely free of charge.
  The development of OLAT started in 1999 at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, 
  where it is the strategic learning management system and deployed on the main OLAT 
  server. For further information see our main project website.
  This site contains information chiefly of interest to developers e.g., source code
  documentation, unit testing information and static code analysis output.  In 
  addition you will also find technical project information (e.g., links to
  issue management, version control and project statistics etc.)</comment>
