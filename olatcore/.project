  <comment>Welcome to the OLAT (Online Learning And Training) Developer Project Site.  This site
  contains materials chiefly of concern to developers (e.g., unit testing and SCA output etc.)
  and is rebuilt periodically on a regular basis.  The site structure is divided between
  project information (e.g., infrastructure, mailiing lists, repositories etc.) and reports
  (e.g., unit testing, SCAs etc.)

  The development of OLAT itself started in 1999 at the University of Zurich, Switzerland,
  where it is the strategic learning management system.  For further information see our main project website. NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
